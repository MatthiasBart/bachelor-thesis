	abstract = {Abstract
            Overnight, Apple has turned its hundreds-of-million-device ecosystem into the world‚Äôs largest crowd-sourced location tracking network called o{\textasciitilde}ine finding ({OF}). {OF} leverages online finder devices to detect the presence of missing o{\textasciitilde}ine devices using Bluetooth and report an approximate location back to the owner via the Internet. While {OF} is not the first system of its kind, it is the first to commit to strong privacy goals. In particular, {OF} aims to ensure finder anonymity, prevent tracking of owner devices, and confidentiality of location reports. This paper presents the first comprehensive security and privacy analysis of {OF}. To this end, we recover the specifications of the closed-source {OF} protocols by means of reverse engineering. We experimentally show that unauthorized access to the location reports allows for accurate device tracking and retrieving a user‚Äôs top locations with an error in the order of 10 meters in urban areas. While we find that {OF}‚Äôs design achieves its privacy goals, we discover two distinct design and implementation flaws that can lead to a location correlation attack and unauthorized access to the location history of the past seven days, which could deanonymize users. Apple has partially addressed the issues following our responsible disclosure. Finally, we make our research artifacts publicly available.},
