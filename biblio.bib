abstract = {ShAir is a middleware infrastructure that allows mobile applications to share resources of their devices (e.g., data, storage, connectivity, computation) in a transparent way. The goals of ShAir are: (i) abstracting the creation and maintenance of opportunistic delay-tolerant peer-to-peer networks; (ii) being decoupled from the actual hardware and network platform; (iii) extensibility in terms of supported hardware, protocols, and on the type of resources that can be shared; (iv) being capable of self-adapting at run-time; (v) enabling the development of applications that are easier to design, test, and simulate. In this paper we discuss the design, extensibility, and maintainability of the ShAir middleware, and how to use it as a platform for collaborative resource-sharing applications. Finally we show our experience in designing and testing a file-sharing application.},

abstract = {In this paper, we study the fundamental problem of gossip in the mobile telephone model: a recently introduced variation of the classical telephone model modified to better describe the local peer-to-peer communication services implemented in many popular smartphone operating systems. In more detail, the mobile telephone model differs from the classical telephone model in three ways: (1) each device can participate in at most one connection per round; (2) the network topology can undergo a parameterized rate of change; and (3) devices can advertise a parameterized number of bits about their state to their neighbors in each round before connection attempts are initiated. We begin by describing and analyzing new randomized gossip algorithms in this model under the harsh assumption of a network topology that can change completely in every round. We prove a significant time complexity gap between the case where nodes can advertise 0 bits to their neighbors in each round, and the case where nodes can advertise 1 bit. For the latter assumption, we present two solutions: the first depends on a shared randomness source, while the second eliminates this assumption using a pseudorandomness generator we prove to exist with a novel generalization of a classical result from the study of two-party communication complexity. We then turn our attention to the easier case where the topology graph is stable, and describe and analyze a new gossip algorithm that provides a substantial performance improvement for many parameters. We conclude by studying a relaxed version of gossip in which it is only necessary for nodes to each learn a specified fraction of the messages in the system. We prove that our existing algorithms for dynamic network topologies and a single advertising bit solve this relaxed version up to a polynomial factor faster (in network size) for many parameters. These are the first known gossip results for the mobile telephone model, and they significantly expand our understanding of how to communicate and coordinate in this increasingly relevant setting.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present the design and evaluation of a near-field communication-based mobile p2p payment application, called mFerio, that is designed to replace cash-based transactions. We first identify design criteria that payment systems should satisfy and then explain how mFerio, relative to those criteria, improves on the limitations of cash-based systems. We next describe mFerio's implementation and user interface design, focusing on the balance between usability and security. Finally, we present the results of a two-phase user study, involving a total of 104 people, that shows that mFerio has low cognitive load and is also fast, accurate, and easy to use - even outperforming cash in terms of speed and cognitive load in common payment situations.},

abstract = {Given the emerging technological development in the fields of telecommunication and smart mobile devices, the number of connected devices around the world is increasing rapidly. Moreover, the tendency to use these small devices is increasing steadily as their capabilities and efficiency increase. Progress in these areas has been an incentive and a reason for enhancing distributed systems, Internet of things and mobile collaborative computing. The advances in hardware and software technologies have necessitated the development of new communication standards adapted to devices constrained in resources in all areas, energy, computing power, memory and bandwidth. These communication standards have a crucial role in enhancing the IOT and other architectures of mobile collaborative computing such as Cloud, Fog, Edge, and Mobile Edge Computing. In this paper, we will review the current communication standards and protocols by showing its role in strengthening mobile communication networks in the different architectures of mobile collaborative computing and under the different circumstances. More specifically, we will illustrate, within a new proposed approach, how they can maintain an efficient connection even between mobile devices on the periphery and how they can establish autonomous mobile networks by using peer-to-peer communication via Wi-Fi Direct and other technologies.},
