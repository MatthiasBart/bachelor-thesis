//MARK: This tells why ad hoc is important
Nowadays communication between smartphones or tablets invariably relies on infrastructure. In most homes in developed countries one can find a local network advertised by WiFi technology and handled by a router. Being outside and not connected to a local network, mobile devices communicate with cellular towers that give access to a big underlying network managed by an ISP. Wherever we go, our mobile devices are connected, but relying on infrastructure that is not necessarily available all the time. Different reasons can lead to restricted or broken infrastructure which, in absence of ad-hoc technologies would break all communication. In countries with governmental protests cellular networks might be restricted or monitored, infrastructure could be overwhelmed, due to a high number of people trying to access the system simultaniously or environmental disasters could take down cellular towers or their power supply. In all these cases users would highly profit from ad-hoc networks, that do not merely rely on any external dependencies.

Nowadays many different technologies exist to gain access to wide area ad-hoc connections like LTE-Direct or LoraWan. Unfortunately these technologies are not yet supported in smartphones and there is no guarantee that they will ever be. However modern smartphones improved support for local peer-to-peer (P2P) technologies in recent years, that allow devices to directly communicate via local radio link broadcasts. This could improve connectivity in the aforementioned cases or enable scenarios in which numerous end devices connect together, to form a wide spread mesh network. The first technology that comes to mind is Bluetooth. First introduced in 1998 has already been used in mobile computing the last decades, but due to limited data transfer rates a new approach started to enter the market. These days WiFi is predominantly used to facilitate local P2P connections between smartphones, whereby unfortunately every mobile operating system has created its own version which makes communication between different vendors complex. Furthermore, the extent to which these technologies can provide stable data transfer and the quality with which they can do so, remains unclear or poorly documented. Since this information is essential for a further evaluation of the feasibility of applications based on direct P2P connections, this thesis aims to address the existing uncertainty by measuring metrics that can assist the evaluation of analogous applications. 
// In the contemporary era, the utilisation of smartphones or tablets for communication invariably depends on the existence of infrastructure. In many developed countries, residential properties are equipped with local networks that utilise WiFi technology and are managed by routers. In the absence of a local network, mobile devices utilise cellular towers to access a vast underlying network, which is managed by an Internet Service Provider (ISP). This reliance on infrastructure, however, is not guaranteed, as it is subject to the availability of the necessary infrastructure. The presence of restricted or broken infrastructure can be attributed to various reasons, which, in the absence of ad-hoc technologies, would result in the cessation of all communication. In countries experiencing governmental unrest, cellular networks may be subject to restrictions or monitoring. A further reason for the failure of infrastructure networks could be overwhelming usage, where a high number of people attempt to use the same ISP tower, or environmental disasters which take down power supply or network nodes. In such circumstances, ad-hoc networks, which do not rely on external dependencies, become a highly advantageous solution for users. In recent years, there has been an enhancement in the support for local peer-to-peer technologies in modern smartphones, which facilitate direct communication via local radio link broadcasts. This technological benefit has the potential to facilitate scenarios where numerous end devices can connect and collaborate to form a wide-spread mesh network, or to enhance connectivity by bypassing the need for accessible infrastructure. It is evident that there is a plethora of technologies that facilitate wide-area ad hoc connections, including LTE-Direct and LoraWan. However, it is important to note that these technologies are not yet supported in smartphones and there is no guarantee that they will ever be. These days WiFi is predominantly used for the purpose of facilitating local peer-to-peer connectivity. However, it is important to note that each provider has developed its own unique version of this technology, which has the unfortunate consequence of complicating communication between smartphones that operate on divergent operating systems. Furthermore, the extent to which these technologies can facilitate data transfer, and the quality with which they can do so, remains to be ascertained. This is essential for the subsequent evaluation of the feasibility of applications based on direct peer-to-peer transfer. This thesis aims to address this existing uncertainty by measuring metrics that can assist in evaluating the feasibility of analogous applications.

  [Most smartphone communication leverages one hop radio links to cell towers or WiFi access points. In recent years, however, the major smartphone operating systems have included increasingly stable and useful support for local peer-to-peer communication that allows a device to talk directly to a nearby device (using local radio broadcast) while avoiding cellular and WiFi infrastructure. The ability to create these local links, combined with the ubiquity of smartphones, enables scenarios in which large groups of nearby smartphone users run applications that create peer-to-peer meshes supporting infrastructure-free networking. There are many possible motivations for these smartphone peer-to-peer networks. For example, they can support communication in settings where network infrastructure is censored (e.g., government protests), overwhelmed (e.g., a large festival or march), or unavailable (e.g., after a disaster or at a remote event). In addition, in developing countries, cellular data minutes are often bought in blocks and carefully conservedâ€”increasing interest in networking operations that do not require cellular infrastructure.], [#cite(<Newport_2017>, form: "author"), #cite(<Newport_2017>, form: "year")],

As of 2024 4 billion people worldwide are carrying smartphones @Statista_Research_Department_2024 with them. Twenty seven percent of them are developed and manufactured by one of the most valuable companies in the world. Since 2007, when the first iPhone was released on 27th of June Apple has sold more than 2.3 billion devices. This makes iOS one of the most used mobile operating systems worldwide with a current market share of 27%. iOS also utilizes its own implementation of a P2P WiFi protocol which is strongly used by Apples Continuity which bundles applications like AirDrop or AirPlay, Universal Clipboard, Handoff or WiFi password sharing for contacts that want to join your network.

Apples P2P WiFi implementation is called Apple Wireless Direct Link (AWDL) and is an undocumented protocol that is based on the 802.11 ad-hoc WiFi standard which did not live up to its expectations. This protocol is not only used by Continuity but is also accessible to iOS application developers via different frameworks that operate on different layers of abstraction. 

One of these frameworks is called Multipeer Connectivity. Newport describes it as an implementation of the mobile telephone model #cite(<Newport_2017>, form: "year") in his article about gossip in smartphone P2P networks. Apple states, the framework "supports the discovery of services provided by nearby devices and supports communicating with those services through message-based data, streaming data, and resources (such as files). In iOS, the framework uses infrastructure Wi-Fi networks, peer-to-peer Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth personal area networks for the underlying transport. In macOS and tvOS, it uses infrastructure Wi-Fi, peer-to-peer Wi-Fi, and Ethernet." Contrary to this documentation, tests and information gathered from Apple's developer forum conclude that Mulipeer Connectivty does not support Bluetooth for P2P networking anymore. In an approach to give a brief overview about Apples networking APIs, Apple describes Multipeer Connectivity as a high-level interface to Apples P2P WiFi support and also introduces the Network Framework, which is considered as a low-level interface by Apple engineers. Apples Documentation states developers should use this framework when they need direct access to protocols like TLS, TCP, and UDP for their custom application protocols. The Network framework does not support connecting via Bluetooth, which is accessible through the Core Bluetooth Framework. 

//MARK: source for AWDL is recommended developer forums
Although Bluetooth is more versatile, compatible with devices from other vendors and has improved range and speed in mobile end devices in recent years, AWDL is the recommended technology to establish direct links between iOS devices.

//MARK: why use different transport layer protcols and compare them 
Therefore the Networking Framework, included in the iOS SDK is used to establish and test the quality of connections between iOS devices, which exposes a transport layer interface to use and control protocols like UDP, TCP or QUIC. 

This thesis analyses and measures the capabilities of the latest iOS devices to communicate via direct #gls("ptp") networks. Since most of current technology standards rely heavily on external infrastructure with powerful receiver antennas, direct #gls("ptp") communication is not yet wide spread third party applications or optimized to function over long distances. However it is unclear, where the boundaries of the current implementations lie and which type of applications could be implemented with direct #gls("ptp"). The results aim to help assess feasibility of different applications that build upon AWDL. Examples vary from secure communication applications to city wide mesh networks or improved reachability in dangerous situations where no cellular network is in reach.

== Research Definition

This research should help assess feasibility of applications that want to utilise AWDL. It will compare different transport layer protocols in different scenarios. This scenarios will vary in distance, surroundings and transmission data sizes. The Networking Framework is used to quantify the connection through metrics like RTT, jitter, package loss and more and is subsequently referred to as connection quality.

*Research Questions*

Which aspects influence the AWDL connection quality and how far can it reach?

*Hypothesis*

$H_1$

AWDL connection quality on Apple devices depends on the surroundings and functions worse in crowded surroundings.

$H_2$

AWDL connection quality on Apple devices depends on the transport layer protocol.

*Method*

A prototype application will be developed for the iOS platform that will serve as a tool to measure the connection quality. The metrics will be precisely defined in the test protocol in @implementation. In addition, different testing surroundings, indicating various characteristics of real life scenarios will be tested to cover most areas of application. Measurement of connection quality will be purely based on values captured by the prototype app itself. The characteristics of the environment will be described based on human perceive and measured with suitable methods.

== Summary

Smartphones mostly rely on infrasructure based networks. As this is a strong dependency that could vastly limit connectivity and advancements in direct connection software and hardware have emerged in recent years it is unclear which connection qualities these methods can produce. Therefore a prototype application developed for the iOS platform serves as a utility for measuring these metrics, with heavy use of the low level Networking Framework API.

//Since the latest smartphones have improved hardware and operating system support for direct #gls("ptp"), it is unclear how well these technologies can currently serve direct communication under different conditions. Focusing on the Apple platform, an iOS application is developed, that serves as testing utility. After discussing related work that summarizes past attempts, considerations and benefits of direct communication in @relatedwork, @background will provide all required knowledge to understand the concepts of the design and decisions made to best answer if or when latest technology is/will be ready to rely on direct #gls("ptp") communication.

// == Motivation 
 
// *Motivation.* Modern mobile devices can make use of a wide variety of communication technologies. Besides having different applicabilities and protocols, standards like Bluetooth, WiFi or 5G need to be wireless to seamlessly transfer data. In resent years global economic demand has impacted research and development to vastly improve data transmission and hardware on smartphones. As of 2024 this led to over 4 billion smartphones users worldwide \Statista_2024. Unfortunately most of the communication methods used on smartphones all rely on mediators. Be it a router in a local network or a cell tower in a cellular network, without these nodes a connection between two peers can not be established, no matter how close neighboring devices may be. However in scenarios where the required infrastructure is not available or data needs to be handled sensitive, communication between two mobile devices can be established via Bluetooth or peer-to-peer WiFi since these do not required pre-existing infrastructure and purely rely on local radio broadcast, whereas the latter is recommended to use. Due to the latest advancements in these technologies and smartphone hardware, it is unclear how good direct #gls("ptp") networks work under certain conditions. This thesis tries to find and measure metrics that indicate the quality of direct #gls("ptp") connections on Apple's mobile devices. This can help to evaluate the feasibility of projects that are planning to build on these technologies. In particular the AWDL will be tested for its robustness considering metrics of quality in different scenarios and under different conditions measured from the application layer.

// *Use cases.* Like already mentioned in *Motivation*, direct #gls("ptp") technologies leverage ad-hoc networks to enable communication even when no infrastructure is available. Reasons can vary from environmental disasters to the lack of coverage in less developed countries or instances of governmental censorship. In addition to facilitating communication, this technology can also be employed in location based services.  For example, advertising based on proximity to an upcoming football match, or social media that could tell the user about nearby friends without the necessity to access GPS data. TODO...a bit MORE Usecases, because there are actually a lot. Moreover, confirming to a well defined protocol could also improve interoperability between apps, where social media applications could benefit from advertising proximity beacons of nearby independent shops.
