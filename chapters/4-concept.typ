#lorem(30)

describe the overall concept of what you have planned

what is the purpose of the app, how are you planning to measure the metrics and implement these measurements in the app

maybe describe which metrics you want to test, but this goes a bit too far into implementation 

maybe describe in general your approach to a test protocol and that you want to test it in different scenarios and why you think that these different scenarios are important and how you plan to visiualize the results,



#todo(
  [ Describe an overall concept of a solution, which could possibly solve a given
    problem. Design a novel solution and visualise the architecture and relevant
    (data) flows. Compare and relate your approach to possible alternatives and
    argue why and in which way(s) the suggested solution(s) will be better. ],

  *Hints for formatting in Typst*:

  + You can use built-in styles:
    + with underscore (\_) to _emphasise_ text
    + forward dash (\`) for `monospaced` text
    + asterisk (\*) for *strong* (bold) text

  You can create and use your own (custom) formatting macros:

  + check out the custom style (see in file `lib.typ`):
    + `#textit` for #textit([italic]) text
    + `#textbf` for #textbf([bold face]) text
